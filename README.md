# Host Server Manager

This project implements the gRPC Server Manager API.
Different from the Server Manager, the Host Server Manager does not instantiate a Cartesi Server.
Instead, it makes HTTP requests directly to a DApp running in the host machine.
This project also simulates the Inspect HTTP API provided by the Inspect Container.
